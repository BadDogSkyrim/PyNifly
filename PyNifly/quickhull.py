"""A simple implementation of the quick hull algorithm.

Usually you should only need the L{qhull3d} function, although the module
contains some potentially useful helper functions as well.

Examples
========

Tetrahedron
-----------

>>> import random

...     gamma = 1 - alpha - beta
...     if gamma >= 0:
...         tetrahedron.append((alpha, beta, gamma))
>>> verts, triangles = qhull3d(tetrahedron)
>>> (0,0,0) in verts

A degenerate shape: the unit square
-----------------------------------
